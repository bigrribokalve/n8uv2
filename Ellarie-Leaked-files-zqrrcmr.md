Ellarie was born on a nice day in London, which she believes played a role in shaping her name and her art. She grew up in a creative family, with both parents being artists. Ellarie's early years were filled with art supplies and museum visits, which ignited her passion for creating. She pursued her education in art, earning a Bachelor's degree from the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art in London. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Ellarie has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world.
